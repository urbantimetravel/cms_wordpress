[ProfileGrid](https://profilegrid.co/) is a power-packed user profile, member and directory plugin. While ProfileGrid is fundamentally a user profile builder, it also offers User Groups. Groups are equivalent to Profile types where you can have different profile structures for different group of users. Advantages of Group based system is apparent from the very beginning:

* You can have multiple User Profile types.
* Each Group can have its own set of fields.
* Each Group can have its own Group Manager or Moderator.
* Group Manager can have special privacy level for group members.
* Each group can have its own registration workflow.
* You can offer visitors option to sign up or request membership for Group of their choice.
* Groups can have membership limits.
* Groups can be mapped to a specific WordPress Roles.
* Filter user profiles based on groups on directories page.
* Groups can be Open (public) or Closed (private)
* Closed Groups require membership approval from Group Manager or site Admin
* Users can join multiple Groups

And so much more!

If you do not need multiple Groups, there’s nothing stopping you to use the default Group as single profile type, membership or as user directories system. It's a unique WordPress profile plugin that's flexible and modular. A lot of stuff can be turned on or off by single click.

ProfileGrid is pretty both on the frontend AND the dashboard area. We understand you spend a lot of time inside the dashboard, therefore, we made sure the admin facing interface is clean and organized. You will absolutely love it when you first log into ProfileGrid. And it looks even better once profiles start to fill in!

With release of version 4.1.0 we have added a bunch of new shortcodes which offer amazing amount of flexibility with displaying different types of user groups and user profiles data inside your WordPress theme and widgets. Brand new content enclosure shortcodes allow you to take control of content restrictions and membership access to granular level. Using new dynamic content shortcodes you can create personalized content for your users.
